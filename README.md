A generic connection pool for Rust.

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/r2d2)

Opening a new database connection every time one is needed is both inefficient
and can lead to resource exhaustion under high traffic conditions. A connection
pool maintains a set of open connections to a database, handing them out for
repeated use.

r2d2 is agnostic to the connection type it is managing. Implementors of the
`ManageConnection` trait provide the database-specific logic to create and
check the health of connections.

# Example

Using an imaginary "foodb" database.

```rust
use std::thread;

extern crate r2d2;
extern crate r2d2_foodb;

fn main() {
    let manager = r2d2_foodb::FooConnectionManager::new("localhost:1234");
    let pool = r2d2::Pool::builder()
        .max_size(15)
        .build(manager)
        .unwrap();

    for _ in 0..20 {
        let pool = pool.clone();
        thread::spawn(move || {
            let conn = pool.get().unwrap();
            // use the connection
            // it will be returned to the pool when it falls out of scope.
        })
    }
}
```
